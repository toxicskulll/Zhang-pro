**Zhang-pro** is a research-oriented project designed to implement AI-driven solutions for IoT energy harvesting and predictive analytics. This repository contains scripts, data processing pipelines, models, and simulation tools to analyze and optimize sensor operations based on environmental data.

## Features

* Preprocessing of IoT and environmental datasets
* Energy prediction models using Regression and LSTM
* Decision engine for dynamic sensor scheduling
* Simulation framework to evaluate energy efficiency and sensor uptime
* Visualization dashboards for predicted vs actual energy, sensor activity, and storage levels

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toxicskulll/Zhang-pro.git
cd Zhang-pro
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Requires Python 3.8 or higher.

## Usage

1. Place your IoT dataset in the `data/` directory (or use the provided sample data).

2. Preprocess the data:

```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
```

3. Train the AI model:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

4. Run the simulation & decision engine:

```bash
python scripts/simulate.py
```

5. Visualize results:

```bash
python scripts/visualize.py
```
